# ODD Appendix Template

> Template for ODD appendices that elaborate on core principles.

## Description

This template defines the standard structure for ODD appendices. Appendices elaborate on ODD principles with deeper analysis, examples, or edge cases. They are still universal (not implementation-specific) but are tier 2 content—revealed after the core principles.

## When to Add an ODD Appendix

Add an ODD appendix when:

- It elaborates on an existing ODD principle
- It's universal (not klappy.dev-specific)
- It's too detailed for the core principle document

Do NOT add an ODD appendix when:

- It's implementation-specific → `/docs/appendices/`
- It's a new core principle → `/odd/`
- It's a decision record → `/odd/decisions/`
