# Progressive Elevation & Decay

> How artifacts move from ephemeral attempts to durable Canon through strict elevation criteria.

## Description

ODD treats durable thinking as scarce and generated artifacts as abundant—most should decay while only patterns that reduce future drag should elevate. The five layers of portability are Conversation/Attempt, Project/PRD, Interoperability/Contracts, Canon, and Decision Trace. Elevation requires recurrence, portability, drag reduction, and testability; if any criterion fails, the artifact stays local or dies. Elevation must be deliberately triggered—typically after refactors, repeated friction, or closed attempts.

## Content

## Summary

ODD treats **durable thinking** as scarce and **generated artifacts** as abundant.

Most artifacts should **decay** (be discarded or sealed as evidence).
Only patterns that repeatedly reduce future drag should **elevate** into more durable layers.

This is how the repository avoids documentation sprawl while remaining portable across:
- time (future-you),
- people (collaborators),
- and agents (tooling that reasons over the corpus).

---

## The Five Layers of Portability

### 1) Conversation / Attempt (Ephemeral)

**What it is:** raw chats, prompts, branches, quick experiments, and run folders.  
**Default fate:** extract value → seal evidence → discard everything else.

**Lives in:**
- project attempt directories
- transient branches / worktrees
- PRD patches produced by failure

**Elevate when:** a failure mode repeats and you can state it as a stable rule, constraint, or test.

---

### 2) Project / PRD (Project-Local)

**What it is:** current intent for a specific project.  
**Default fate:** churn freely. PRDs are disposable and should change as reality is observed.

**Lives in:**
- project PRD documents

**Elevate when:** a requirement becomes reusable across projects, or becomes an interface boundary.

---

### 3) Interoperability / Contracts (Portability Bridge)

**What it is:** explicit interfaces that allow portability across tools, agents, and products.

Contracts are where compatibility becomes real.

**Lives in:**
- `/interfaces/**` (semver'd contracts)
- shared inputs/outputs, schemas, stable runtime paths

**Elevate when:** multiple projects repeatedly need the same boundary and drift becomes expensive.

---

### 4) Canon (Durable, Lean)

**What it is:** curated, high-signal rules and lenses that survive multiple contexts.

Canon is intentionally small. If it bloats, that is a signal to curate harder, not to add more.

**Lives in:**
- `/canon/**`

**Elevate when:** a pattern recurs across multiple projects/lenses and stays true even when tooling changes.

---

### 5) Decision Trace (Why It Changed)

**What it is:** lightweight records explaining why the system moved.

Decisions preserve context without polluting Canon with history.

**Lives in:**
- `/odd/decisions/**`

**Elevate when:** a change affects interpretation, compatibility, or the "rules of the game."

---

## Elevation Criteria (Strict)

Something may be elevated only if it satisfies all of the following:

1. **Recurrence**: it appears across multiple attempts or projects (not a one-off).
2. **Portability**: it remains true across different stacks/models/tools.
3. **Drag Reduction**: it prevents repeated confusion, re-explanation, or failure.
4. **Testability**: it can be expressed as a check, constraint, or falsifiable claim.

If any criterion fails, the artifact stays local (Attempt/PRD) or dies.

---

## Elevation Trigger Points

Elevation does not happen automatically. It requires deliberate evaluation at specific moments.

### When to Evaluate for Elevation

**After substantial refactors:**
When restructuring how something works (not just fixing bugs), pause and ask:
- What did we learn?
- Is this a pattern that will recur?
- Should this be documented at a higher layer?

**After repeated friction:**
When the same confusion or failure occurs multiple times:
- Document the pattern at the appropriate layer
- If it affects multiple projects, elevate to Canon
- If it's universal, elevate to ODD

**After successful attempts:**
When an attempt succeeds, extract learnings before moving on:
- What constraints prevented failure?
- What decision made this work?
- Would this help future attempts in other projects?

**After failed attempts:**
Failures often reveal more than successes:
- What assumption was violated?
- What rule would have prevented this?
- Is this failure mode likely to recur?

### The Elevation Process

1. **Document locally first** — Write the learning where it happened (attempt evidence, project decision)
2. **Tag for review** — Mark patterns that might be elevation candidates
3. **Test recurrence** — Wait for the pattern to appear again (don't elevate on first occurrence)
4. **Promote deliberately** — Move to higher layer only when all elevation criteria are met
5. **Update references** — Ensure lower layers reference the elevated document

### Why This Matters

Without deliberate trigger points:
- Learnings stay trapped in attempt folders
- The same mistakes repeat across lanes
- Canon never gets the benefit of hard-won knowledge
- The system appears to learn but actually forgets

Elevation is not automatic. It is a deliberate act of curation that must be triggered by specific events.

---

## Decay Rule (Default)

Most artifacts should not be preserved.

ODD assumes:
- generation is abundant,
- maintenance is the tax you pay forever,
- and residue creates epistemic drift.

Discarding is not nihilism. It is how the system stays legible.

---

## Where This Fits With Projects and Epochs

- **Projects** isolate intent and success criteria so that unrelated surfaces do not drift together.
- **Epochs** define comparability boundaries when the "rules of the game" change.

This document explains the memory model underneath both.
