# Cognitive Partitioning

> Why reasoning systems must divide under pressure, just like execution systems do.

## Description

As systems accumulate tools, context, and responsibilities, the decision surface of a
single reasoning entity expands faster than its reliability.

Cognitive Partitioning names this constraint and explains why isolating reasoning
responsibilities becomes necessary as systems scale. The concept is universal and
does not prescribe any specific implementation.

## The Failure Mode

When a reasoning system has access to too many valid actions, it begins to fail
not from lack of capability, but from excess choice.

Symptoms include hesitation, inconsistent behavior, over-exploration, and repeated
clarification loops — even when the tools themselves are "correct."

---

## The Constraint

Decision complexity grows faster than execution capability.

Past a threshold, adding more tools can degrade reliability unless reasoning scope
is reduced.

---

## Analogy: Hiring Too Early

The same failure mode appears in early-stage teams.

Effective startups rarely hire a large staff upfront and then decide what each
person should do. Instead, they operate with a small, generalist core until
specific pain becomes visible — missed deadlines, overloaded founders, or repeated
failures in a narrow area.

Hiring occurs in response to pressure, not anticipation.

Teams that hire ahead of demonstrated need experience the same symptoms as
overloaded reasoning systems:
- unclear ownership
- duplicated or conflicting work
- excessive coordination
- founders managing people instead of outcomes

Cognitive Partitioning follows the same rule. Reasoning capacity is expanded only
when existing structures can no longer reliably absorb the load.

## Relationship to Other ODD Concepts

Product Lanes partition execution to preserve evidence integrity.
Cognitive Partitioning applies the same pressure logic to reasoning itself.

## Non-goals

This document does not define:
- specific agents
- specific tools or MCP servers
- orchestration frameworks
- required workflows

It explains why systems evolve toward isolation as complexity grows.
