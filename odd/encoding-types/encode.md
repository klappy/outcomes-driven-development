# Encoding Type: Encode (E)

> The meta-level action of crystallizing a D, O, L, C, H, or Open into a structured, quality-scored artifact. Encode is a receipt that capture happened, not another category of content.

---

## Summary — The Self-Audit Layer

Encode tracks the crystallization work itself. Every time `oddkit_encode` runs, it takes one or more DOLCHEO artifacts and structures them — producing a quality score, a persistence flag, and suggestions for improvement. Recording the Encode event as its own entry closes the loop between "discussed" and "captured." A ledger with five Decisions and zero Encodes says the decisions were mentioned but never formally processed. A ledger with Encodes but no corresponding saves says crystallization happened and the artifacts were lost in the response stream (see `docs/oddkit/proactive/encode-does-not-persist.md`). Both gaps are visible from the E entries alone.
