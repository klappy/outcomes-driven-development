# Epistemic Obligation and Document Tiers

> Document tiers define epistemic obligation, not importance.

## Description

This document explains the three-tier system used to organize content in this repository. Tiers are not about importance, value, or quality. They are about epistemic obligation—how much a reader or system is obligated to absorb and respect content at each level. Tier 1 carries foundational obligation and rarely changes. Tier 2 carries shared obligation and evolves carefully. Tier 3 carries awareness without obligation and may change freely. Tiers are orthogonal to folders. Any folder may contain documents at any tier.

## Operating Constraints

- MUST absorb Tier 1 content fully before proceeding; contradiction is a serious error
- MUST respect Tier 2 content by default; deviation requires documented justification
- MUST NOT conflate tier with importance; tiers describe epistemic obligation, not value
- MUST NOT use Tier 0 as "low importance"; Tier 0 is scope exclusion from the epistemic system entirely
- MUST treat tiers as orthogonal to folders; any folder may contain documents at any tier

---

## Defaults

- Tier 1: absorb fully, do not contradict, do not reinterpret without explicit justification
- Tier 2: follow by default, document deviations, respect unless explicitly overridden
- Tier 3: reference when relevant, may ignore when not applicable, free to rebuild
- Tier 0: exclude from agent context, exclude from context-packs, not comparable to Tier 1-3
- When uncertain about tier assignment, ask: "How much must I internalize this before proceeding?"

---

## Failure Modes

- **Tier as Importance**: Treating Tier 1 as "most important" and Tier 3 as "least important"
- **Ignoring Relevant Tier 3**: Skipping Tier 3 content that matters for specific execution
- **Over-weighting Tier 1**: Applying Tier 1 content when it doesn't apply to current task
- **False Elevation**: Putting low-obligation content at Tier 2, creating false urgency
- **Tier 0 Confusion**: Treating Tier 0 as low-obligation rather than scope-excluded

---

## Verification

- Tier assignment reflects epistemic obligation, not perceived importance
- Tier 1 content is stable, rarely changed, and contradictions are treated as serious errors
- Tier 2 deviations are documented with explicit justification
- Tier 0 content is excluded from agent reasoning and context-packs
- Folder placement and tier assignment are independent decisions

## Content

**Canon v0.1**

### What Tiers Mean

Tiers describe epistemic obligation:

| Tier | Obligation Level | Decay Rate | Change Frequency |
|------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Must absorb | Almost never | Rarely |
| **Tier 2** | Should respect | Carefully | Occasionally |
| **Tier 3** | May reference | Freely | Frequently |

The tier system answers: *"How much must I internalize this before proceeding?"*

### Tier 1: Foundational Obligation

Tier 1 content must be fully absorbed before proceeding. It cannot be safely ignored or skimmed.

**Characteristics:**

- Contradiction is a serious error
- Reinterpretation requires explicit justification
- Changes are rare and deliberate
- Stability is expected across long timescales

**Epistemic obligation:** Absorb fully. Do not contradict. Do not reinterpret without explicit justification.

**Cross-folder examples:** A manifesto in odd/, a core constraint in canon/, or a critical process in docs/ could all be Tier 1.

### Tier 2: Shared Obligation

Tier 2 content should be respected by default. It represents agreed conventions that apply unless explicitly overridden.

**Characteristics:**

- Deviation is allowed but must be documented
- Changes happen carefully with awareness of downstream impact
- Content is stable but not immutable
- Readers should know this content exists and follow it unless they have reason not to

**Epistemic obligation:** Respect unless explicitly overridden. Follow by default. Document deviations.

**Cross-folder examples:** A decision record in odd/, a shared rule in canon/, or a standard process in docs/ could all be Tier 2.

### Tier 3: Awareness Without Obligation

Tier 3 content is available for reference but carries no obligation to internalize. It exists so you can find it when needed.

**Characteristics:**

- May be ignored when not relevant
- Changes freely without requiring broad awareness
- Useful for specific tasks, not general orientation
- Can be rebuilt or discarded without system-wide impact

**Epistemic obligation:** Reference when relevant. May ignore when not applicable. Free to rebuild.

**Cross-folder examples:** An appendix in odd/, a template in canon/, or a how-to guide in docs/ could all be Tier 3.

### Why Tier 3 Exists

Tier 3 exists because not everything needs to be internalized.

Some content:

- Is useful only in specific contexts
- Changes frequently without broad impact
- Serves reference purposes rather than orientation
- Deserves documentation without demanding absorption

Without Tier 3, either:
- Low-obligation content gets elevated to Tier 2 (creating false urgency)
- Low-obligation content goes undocumented (creating knowledge gaps)

Tier 3 gives content a home without giving it unearned epistemic weight.

### Tier 0: Scope Exclusion (Not a Tier)

Tier 0 is not part of the epistemic tier system. It is a scope exclusion marker.

Content marked Tier 0 is:

- Public-facing and intended for human readers
- Excluded from agent reasoning contexts
- Excluded from default context-packs
- Not comparable to Tier 1–3 content

Tier 0 is not "lower obligation than Tier 3." It is outside the epistemic ladder entirely.

**Use Tier 0 for:** About pages, marketing content, visitor-facing explanations—content that exists for humans, not for systems reasoning about the repository.

**Do not confuse:** Tier 0 with Tier 3. Tier 3 is low-obligation content within the epistemic system. Tier 0 is excluded from the epistemic system altogether.

### Tiers Are Not Importance

A common misunderstanding: "Tier 1 is most important, Tier 3 is least important."

This is wrong.

Tiers describe **epistemic obligation**, not **importance**.

| Tier | Epistemic Obligation | Importance |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Tier 1 | High | Varies |
| Tier 2 | Medium | Varies |
| Tier 3 | Low | Varies |

A Tier 3 document might be critically important for today's deployment. A Tier 1 document might be philosophically foundational but irrelevant to a specific task.

**The question tiers answer:** "How much must I internalize this?"

**The question tiers do not answer:** "How important is this?"

Conflating the two leads to either:
- Ignoring Tier 3 content that matters for execution
- Over-weighting Tier 1 content that doesn't apply
